This is a basic XRP wallet built on top of https://github.com/intelliot/xrp-api. 

Generates an XRP address and secret, and displays balance of that address. Eventually, this wallet will be hosted along with the xrp-api server to demonstrate the developer experience using a JSON API to interact with xrp ledger



TODO
- [ ] Add accounts to server without re-starting server
- [ ] Implement Send 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

### Run XRP-API server and generate testnet credentials
This application assumes an instance of the xrp-api is running on port 3000
